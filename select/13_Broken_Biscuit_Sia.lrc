[00:21.44] I'm a broken biscuit
[00:26.76] From the cookie jar
[00:31.99] I'm a total misfit
[00:36.88] In the puzzle that's so far
[00:42.50] Careful not to crush me
[00:47.89] In those hungry hands
[00:53.36] Careful not to rush me
[00:58.24] Into this fine romance
[01:09.24] 
[01:03.79] I stand under the weight of your words
[01:09.09] Hoping you won't find me
[01:14.44] I'm terrified of everything I've heard,
[01:19.41] Don't swallow
[01:25.91] 
[01:36.06] I'm a damaged dollar
[01:41.19] Than no-one wants to change
[01:46.87] I'm a bunch of flowers
[01:51.69] That need to be arranged
[01:57.54] Careful what you wish for
[02:02.60] Careful what you say
[02:07.81] I've lowered all my armour
[02:13.09] Risking the pain again
[02:24.09] 
[02:18.61] I stand under the weight of your words.
[02:24.02] Hoping you won't find me.
[02:29.20] I'm terrified of everything I've heard,
[02:34.23] Don't swallow
[02:40.73] 
[02:40.15] I'm standing on the edge of your words
[02:45.20] That is where you'll find me
[02:50.62] I'm paralysed by all the things that hurt
[02:55.62] But I'm coming
[03:02.62] 
[03:22.85] I stand under the weight of your words
[03:28.02] Hoping you won't find me
[03:33.16] I'm paralysed by all the things I heard
[03:38.20] Don't swallow
[03:44.70] 
[03:44.19] I'm standing on the edge of your words
[03:49.35] Standing on the edge of your words
[03:54.78] I'm paralysed by all the things that hurt
[03:59.69] But I'm coming
