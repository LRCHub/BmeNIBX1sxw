Hold up
Hold up
Hold up

Let me make one thing clear
If you wanna keep on runnin' your mouth
Wastin' my time
Then here's what you gotta do

Go on give it a kiss

This pot's a-boilin' up
Don't press, press your luck
Run you down like a pick-up truck
Cause I'm a freak without warning

Don't make me raise a hand
Drop bombs, Afghanistan
Don't fuck with the master plan
Can't say I didn't warn ya

I think you might have missed it
I think you got it twisted
When I told you to kiss it
My biscuit, my biscuit

I think you might have missed it
I think you got it twisted
When I told you to kiss it
My biscuit, my biscuit

Go on give it a kiss

Who you is tryin' to fool?
Don't broke with the golden rule
You know honey that shit ain't cool
You can't tell me nothin'

You be a parasite
Roll you like a pair of dice
Serve you up, red beans and rice
Yeah I thought I done told ya

I think you might have missed it
I think you got it twisted
When I told you to kiss it
My biscuit, my biscuit

I think you might have missed it
I think you got it twisted
When I told you to kiss it
My biscuit, my biscuit

Go on give it a kiss

I see you baby
Creepin' on me
Creepin' on me
I'm-a put you to sleep

It on the daily
They checkin' on me
Lookin' on beat
Let me tell you what you need

I think you might have missed it baby
I think you got it twisted baby
My biscuit, biscuit

I see you baby
Creepin' on me
Creepin' on me
I'm-a put you to sleep now

It on the daily
They checkin' on me
Lookin' on beat
Let me tell you what you need now
