You never know how much I love you
Cause nothing keeps me going holding you
I'm looking for your heart that beats inside you

Every night it seems so clear
Any dream will disappear without you
Every night it seems so clear
Any dream will disappear without you

Dream
Just dream
Dream
Just dream
We're gonna dream

You never know how much I love you
Cause nothing keeps me going holding you
I'm looking for your heart that beats inside you

Every night it seems so clear
Any dream will disappear without you
Every night it seems so clear
Any dream will disappear without you
