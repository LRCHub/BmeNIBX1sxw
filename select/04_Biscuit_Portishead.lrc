[00:45.75] I'm lost, exposed
[00:53.02] Stranger things will come your way
[00:59.71] It's just I'm scared
[01:04.72] Got hurt a long time ago
[01:07.80] Can't make myself heard
[01:11.87] No matter how hard I scream
[01:15.45] Oh, sensation
[01:20.04] Sin, slave of sensation
[01:31.54] 
[01:29.61] Fully fed, yet I still hunger
[01:38.85] Torn inside
[01:45.10] Haunted I tell myself, yet I still wander
[01:52.68] Down, inside
[01:57.66] It's tearin' me apart
[02:00.78] Oh, sensation
[02:06.74] Sin, slave of sensation
[02:18.24] 
[02:16.78] I'll never fall in-
[02:25.12] I'll never fall in love again
[02:32.25] I'll never-
[02:36.06] I'll never fall in-
[02:41.01] I'll never fall in love again
[02:46.25] I'll never fall-
[02:49.95] I'll never fall in-
[02:52.33] I'll never fall in love again
[03:01.28] It's all over now
[03:09.78] 
[03:04.24] At last, relief
[03:10.69] A mother's son has left me sheer
[03:18.02] The shores I seek
[03:22.14] Are crimson tastes divine
[03:27.68] Can't make myself heard
[03:28.85] No matter how hard I scream
[03:32.23] Oh, sensation
[03:38.03] Sin, slave of sensation
[03:49.53] 
[03:46.68] I'll never fall in love
[03:53.55] I'll never fall, fall, fall, fall in love
[04:03.55] I'll never fall in love
[04:11.07] I'll never fall in love again
[04:19.63] I'll never, I'll never, I'll never
[04:26.91] I'll never fall in love again
[04:33.02] It's all over now
[04:37.25] It's all over now
[04:47.07] It's, it's, it's, it's all over now
[04:51.02] It's all over now
